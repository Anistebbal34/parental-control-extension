# 🧩 Chrome Extension – Parental Control (React + Vite)

This is a WIP (work-in-progress) **parental control Chrome extension** built with **React** and **Vite**. It's designed to help parents monitor and manage their children's online activity — especially video consumption — with smart features like time tracking, site blocking, and watch history.



> ⚠️ This project is evolving and will be fully **open source**. Stay tuned for server-side integration and user management.
